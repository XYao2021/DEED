# RED Codes
The official Pytorch code for RED-PSGD algorithm. These codes only use for experiments in paper "Compressed Decentralized Learning With Error Feedback Under Data Heterogeneity" for ICLR 2025.

# Circumstances
The required libraries can be found in "requirements.txt"

# Configures
The configuration parameters can be found in "config.py".

# Datasets
Datasets include FashionMNIST and CIFAR10.

# Models
The models are custimized model for FashionMNIST and CIFAR10.

# Running
To run the experiments, using "python -main.py" command to run the file called "main.py" in the command line. The configurations can be changed by specifying the configuration parameters in the command line after "main.py", the details can be find in file "config.py".
